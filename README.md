# This is a backend project about building API for a simple front page. 
- API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API.
- In this project, Node.js is used as the runtime and MongoDB is the database.
